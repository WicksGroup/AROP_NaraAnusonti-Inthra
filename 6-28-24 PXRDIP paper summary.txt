PXRDIP paper summary

PXRDIP stands for powder x-ray diffraction with image plates, and is used for analyzing the crystal structure and texture of a compressed sample, verifying the solidity, and measuring the density. X-rays are shot into the sample, which is placed just on the front side of the PXRDIP box. The sides of the PXRDIP box are lined with image plates (IP) that wll turn dark when hit by the x-rays. The back of the PXRDIP box contains a circular cutout for the VISAR machine (measures pressure and density). The x-rays are diffracted according to the crystal structure, and these diffracted x-rays are picked up by the IP. The sample is held by a pinhole, made of Ta or Pt, to ensure all the x-rays going into the box have passed through the sample. Lastly, the x-rays will also diffract off of the pinhole material, which have known 2-theta values, allowing for proper alignment when getting data. Next, the ideal source for x-rays is a mono-energetic point-source, which is generated using a plasma in a He-like state. The metal used is either Cu or Fe to create this plasma. These produce a couple extra wavelengths which are all filtered out by a Cu/Fe filter layer on top of the IPs.

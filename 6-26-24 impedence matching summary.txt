Impedance matching summary:
Impedance matching is a technique that allows the pressure of a material of interest to be found, even if necessary information cannot be measured from that material. This is done with the help of a different material, which can be measured. These two materials are then put right next to each other, with the shock wave going through the material of interest first. The resulting shock wave is then measured from the second material. Then, the pressure on the material of interest can be calculated using the physical properties of the two materials. This technique is used for experimental design, shock mitigation, and sympathetic detonation assessments.

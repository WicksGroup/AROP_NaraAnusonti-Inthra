Summary of Materials and Methods of MgO paper:

Sample Preparation:
There was a polyimide ablator, high purity MgO crystals with a thin layer of Al to enhance reflectivity, and a quartz layer for impedance matching.

Laser configuration:
The laser pulses were focused to a 1.1/0.8 mm diameter spot on the polyimide and by varying laser intensity, the pressure systematically increased in the MgO from 176 to 634 GPa.

XRD measurements:
The laser also generates Cu plasma, which diffracts X-rays that are picked up by the IP detectors. The output from those detectors are then aligned using the known diffraction peaks of the Ta pinhole.

Normalized diffraction intensity:
The diffraction intensity is normalized by accounting for variations in x-ray source and in the compressed sample volume, along with preforming a background subtraction.

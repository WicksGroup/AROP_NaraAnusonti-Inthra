Calibration of the SOP (streaked optical pyrometer)

Info on the SOP and why it is important:
-measures the integrated spectral radiance (total photons emitted) over time 
-these measurements are used to determine temperature and entropy
-can get a continuous record of temperature a function of pressure or density by combining the SOP and the VISAR

Experimental setup:
-the laser is shot through all the materials
-use a dichroic mirror
	-reflects lights of a certain wavelength at a 45 degree angle and lets light of a different wavelength pass straight through
	-lets the wavelengths important to the VISAR measurements go up towards the VISAR
	-the photons and wavelengths for temperature go striaght through towards the SOP
-the entrance to the SOP is a filter to stop the photons from the OMEGA laser
	-transmits only light greater than 590 nm
-dove prism (trapezoid thing?) is used so that the SOP can spatially resolve along any orientation on the target
-and then more fancy mirror stuff and gets temperature

MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CALIBRATED WELL FOR THIS TO WORK AND GIVE GOOD DATA

Calibration method:
-calibrated with a light source with a known spetral radiance, OL550 (Optronic Laboratories Standard of Spectral Radiance), has tungesten ribbon filament with a sapphire window
-lamp placed in center of OMEGA target chamber and ajusted until the tunsten ribbon is centered right on the photocathode (important part of measurement tool)

Sources of potential error:
-the ribbon filament not imaged onto the external slit of the SOP ROSS
-providing insufficient intensity for the detector with fast ns sweep windows since it will not be detected in the 5s winodw sweeps
-resolution of streak camera is limited by the projected effective width of the input slit at the CCD
-degration in photocathod due to the loss of cesium which decreases the response at longer wavelengths that doesn't match the predicted
-plasma self-emmision can scatter in the "target" chamber which enter the SOP collection optics, messing up the data
	-background subtraction helps, but it doesn't always compensate enough

Error analysis:
-Monte Carlo routine
-this paper used 100,000 runs
-filter transmission 70.1%
-spectral radiance of lamp 70.1%
-sweep rate 0.5% for slow and 1.5% for fast
-gain 2%
-magnifications 2%
